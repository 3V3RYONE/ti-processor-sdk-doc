Program the eMMC on Beaglebone Black 
====================================

Overview 
-------- 
This documentation provides the flow and scripts for programming the eMMC on a
BeagleBone Black solely via CPSW Ethernet or USB Gadget Mode Ethernet
connection to a Linux host PC. This solution will work with a completely blank
board / EVM. This solution can be used as a base to create a custom production
programming solution. 

In order to accomplish this goal, two main objectives need to happen:
   #. Modify the SDK to boot Linux from the eMMC. Most of this can be done using
      pre-built images provided with the SDK
   #. Use the SDK to build a separate "flasher" image which can be transferred
      from the host PC via Ethernet or USB to program the above image on to the
      eMMC

What is Needed
--------------
*  The most current `Processor SDK for Linux
   <http://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-AM335X>`__ installed on an appropriate
   development system
*  An image to flash. This can be derived from the SDK mentioned above
*  A Linux Filesystem small enough to be peripheral booted, with the
   functionality needed to do the necessary flashing operation. This can be
   derived from the SDK mentioned above 
*  A Linux host PC to serve as a flashing server
*  A `Beaglebone Black <https://www.ti.com/tool/BEAGLEBK>`__
*  A mini-USB or Ethernet cable to connect the Beaglebone Black to the host PC
*  A 5V power supply compatible with the Beaglebone Black
*  A Serial Debug Cable is recommended to monitor U-Boot outputs
*  A configured `TFTP Server
   <../Host/How_to_Setup_Ubuntu_1404_Network_Boot.html>`__
*  The following files available `here <https://git.ti.com/>`__

   * **fetcher.sh** script
   * **flasher.sh** script
   * **interfaces** file
   * **tisdk_am335x-evm-flasher_defconfig** file

Preparing the Flasher Image 
--------------------------- 
Before flashing the eMMC, we need to create the image that will
run on the flash.

#. Populate pre-built U-Boot images from SDK into TFTP folder 

   .. note:: We can use the prebuilt U-Boot images as-is with no modifications
      needed

   .. note:: A configured TFTP Server is necessary for this guide. Steps to
      properly configure a TFTP Server can be found `here 
      <../Host/How_to_Setup_Ubuntu_1404_Network_Boot.html>`__

   * Copy **u-boot-spl.bin-am335x-evm** and **u-boot-am335x-evm.img** files from
     **<Processor-SDK>/board-support/prebuilt-images/** into the root **/tftpboot/**
     folder. **/tftpboot/** is often located under **/var/lib/**


#. Prepare a rootfs to be used as a "flasher tool"

   * Navigate to **<Processor-SDK>/filesystem**

   * Extract SDK-provided "tiny" rootfs:

     * Create a directory called **arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm** under
       **<Processsor-SDK>/filesystem/**
     * Create a tarball from the **arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm** directory
       called **arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm.tar.xz**. 

       :: 

        tar -C arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm -xvf arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm.tar.xz

   * Create an /init link pointing to /sbin/init. The Kernel requires this to
     boot from the initramfs:

     * ``ln -s /sbin/init arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/init``

   * Verify contents of initramfs root folder:

     * ``ls -l arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/``
     * **init** should now be linked to **sbin/init**

   * Copy provided **fetcher.sh** script into
     **arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/etc/init.d/** directory
   * Verify **fetcher.sh** script has been populated into rootfs:

     * ``ls -l arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/etc/init.d/`` 

   * Create a symlink to fetcher.sh into rc5 for automatic startup init runlevel
     5:  

     * ``ln -s -r arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/etc/init.d/fetcher.sh
       arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/etc/rc5.d/S99fetcher.sh``

   * Verify rc5 configuration for presence of symlink:

     * ``ls -l arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/etc/rc5.d/``
     * **S99fetcher.sh** should now be linked to **/init.d/fetcher.sh**

   * Copy provided **interfaces** file into
     **arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm/etc/network/**

     .. note:: This Interfaces file disables the automatic bringup of the
	usb0 interface (i.e., ) and configures it for DHCP
	('iface usb0 inet dhcp'). We want to prevent the automatic bringup because we first
        want to populate a custom Ethernet HW address via 'ip link set usb0
        address ${MAC_ADDR}' in fetcher.sh.

#. Prepare Kernel to be used as a "flasher tool" with baked-in initramfs

   .. note:: You can choose to follow these steps, or use the provided
      **tisdk_am335x-evm-flasher_defconfig** and **.config** files. In this
      case, just make a backup copy of the SDK's original **.config** file named
      **.config.orig** and use the provided **.config** instead.

   * Copy **tisdk_am335x-evm-flasher_defconfig** to
     **<Processor-SDK>/board-support/linux-x.xx.xx+gitAUTOINC+be5389fd85-gbe5389fd85/arch/arm/configs/**
   * Build device defconfig file

     ::

        make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- tisdk_am335x-evm-flasher_defconfig

   * Make a backup copy of .config called .config.orig
   * Edit the current Kernel config using menuconfig as follows:

     :: 

        make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig

     #. Set CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE =
        <Processor-SDK>/filesystem/arago-tiny-image-am335x-evm
        
        Select **General setup**:

     #. Exit menuconfig and save the new configuration


   * Build the Kernel

     * Compile the zImage

       :: 

         make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage

     * Compile the Device Tree Binary (.dtb)

       ::

         make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- am335x-boneblack.dtb
   
   * Copy **<Processor-SDK>/filesystem/arch/arm/boot/zImage** to
     **/tftpboot/**
   * Copy
     **<Processor-SDK>/filesystem/arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-boneblack.dtb**
     to root **/tftpboot/** directory

   * Copy provided **flasher.sh** script to root **/tftpboot/** directory

#. Create eMMC boot partition contents archive **boot_partition.tar.gz** from
   SDK artifacts in a temporary folder and populate into the TFTP home directory
   
   * Create a temporary directory called **~/tmp/**
   * Copy **MLO-am335x-evm** and **u-boot-am335x-evm.img** from
     **<Processor-SDK>/board-support/prebuilt-images/** to the **~/tmp/** directory
   * Rename **MLO-am335x-evm** to **MLO**
   * Rename **u-boot-am335x-evm.img** to **u-boot.uimg**
   * Create tarball from these files

     :: 

        tar -cvf boot_partition.tar.gz MLO u-boot.img

   * Copy **boot_partition.tar.gz** to root directory **/tftpboot/**

#. Populate the "base" TI SDK rootfs image for populating the eMMC rootfs into
   the TFTP gome directory

   * Copy **<Processor-SDK>/filesystem/arago-base-tisdk-image-am335x-evm.tar.xz** to
     root **/tftpboot/** directory

Program the Flash
-----------------
Now that the flash image has been created we can now flash the EVM

.. note:: The EVM must be configured properly to boot via Ethernet and a TFTP
     server must be properly configured to transfer the flash image.

#. Connect EVM to Linux host machine via Ethernet/USB and Serial Debugging Cable 
#. Open an active console window to monitor bootup messages
#. Power on EVM and "strike andy key" to halt U-Boot at prompt
#. Enter command to boot from TFTP server

   :: 

     dhcp && tftp ${fdtaddr} am335x-boneblack.dtb && env set bootargs
     console=${console} && bootz ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}

#. The flasher image should boot, run the fetcher.sh script, copy the flasher.sh
   file, and run it. You should see "Sitara Example Flash Script is complete" if
   the eMMC was successfully programmed.

#. Now reboot the board and verify that it boots successfully

Troubleshooting
---------------
Here are some things to do to debug setup:

* The flasher.sh script expects to receive files from a TFTP server with IP
  address 192.168.1.1. Ensure the host has been manually configured to this
  address. 
* Ensure Toolchain Path has been set before any build commands.
* Utilize `Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/>`__ to monitor network when things go wrong.  
* If Wireshark is not returning a "BOOTP" request, it is likely the Beaglebone
  Black has not bee configured to boot via Ethernet or USB. Set
  SYSBOOT[4:0]=01000b for Ethernet, and SYSBOOT[4:0]=01011b for USB.
