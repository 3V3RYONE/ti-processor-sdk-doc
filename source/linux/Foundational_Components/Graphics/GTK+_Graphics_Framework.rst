GTK+ Graphics Framework
=======================

GTK+, or the GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical
user interfaces.  Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for
projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.

**Please refer https://www.gtk.org/ for additional details on GTK+.**

The PSDK target file system includes the pre-built GTK+ libraries under /usr/lib
for GTK+3 over Wayland support. There is also a comprenhensive GTK+3 demo
application gtk3-demo under /usr/bin to demonstrate GTK+3 APIs and their usages.
