Overview
--------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The general-purpose memory controller (GPMC) is an unified memory
controller dedicated to interfacing external memory devices:

-  Asynchronous SRAM-like memories and application-specific integrated
   circuit (ASIC) devices
-  Asynchronous, synchronous, and page mode (only available in
   non-multiplexed mode) burst NOR flash devices
-  NAND Flash

Driver supports two types of transfers with data path to external memory
device configured to be 16- or 8-bit:

-  Read
-  Write

| In addition driver supports following modes of operation:

-  **GPMC_MODE_BLOCKING:** By default, driver operates in blocking mode.
   In blocking mode, a Task’s code execution is blocked until
   transaction is complete. This ensures only one transaction operates
   at a given time. Driver supports both interrupt or non-interrupt
   based blocking modes.
-  **GPMC_MODE_CALLBACK** In callback mode, an GPMC transaction
   functions asynchronously, which means that it does not block a Task’s
   code execution. After an GPMC transaction is complete, GPMC driver
   calls a user-provided hook function. Only interrupt based callback is
   supported.

In NAND flash mode, driver supports following ECC algorithms:

-  BCH code 8-bit
-  HAMMING code 1-bit

User Interface
--------------

Driver Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: **Board Specific Configuration**
   :name: board-specific-configuration

All the board specific configurations eg:enabling and pin-mux of GPMC
pins should be performed before calling any driver APIs.By default
Board_Init() API supports all initialization sequence for TI supported
EVMs.Refer `Processor SDK RTOS Board
Support <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_Board_Support>`__ for additional
details.

Once the board specific configuration is complete driver API GPMC_init()
can be called to initialize driver

.. rubric:: **GPMC Configuration Structure** 
   :name: gpmc-configuration-structure

GPMC_soc.c file binds driver with hardware attributes on the board
through GPMC_config structure. This structure must be provided to GPMC
driver. It must be initialized before the GPMC_init() function is called
and cannot be changed afterwards. For details about the individual
fields of this structure, see the Doxygen help by opening
PDK_INSTALL_DIR\\packages\\ti\\drv\\gpmc\\docs\\doxygen\\html\\index.html.

APIs
^^^^^

API reference for application:

::

    #include <ti/drv/gpmc/GPMC.h>

 Sample code for initiating GPMC transaction:

::

    ...
    Board_init(boardCfg);
    ...
    ...
    gpmc = GPMC_open(peripheralNum, &gpmcParams);
    ...
    ...

    /* Initiate GPMC transfers. Refer Example for details
    */
    transferOK = GPMC_transfer(gpmc, &gpmcTransaction);
    if (!transferOK) {
    /* GPMC transaction failed */
    }

.. note::
   
   1. GPMC Test Application supports write test, by default write test is
      disabled, user can enable the write test by defining
      TEST_GPMC_FLASH_WRITE in test/src/GPMC_board.h.
   
   2. In GPMC_Test_icev2AM335x, J5 pin2 & 3 should be shorted on
      iceV2AM335x board in order to test GPMC NOR flash.
   
   3. In GPMC_Test_evmAM437x, J2 pin1 & 2 should NOT be shorted on
   evmAM437x board in order to test GPMC NAND flash.
