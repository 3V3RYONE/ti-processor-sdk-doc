.. rubric:: Driver Overview
   :name: driver-overview

The ICSS_EMAC (industrial communications subsystem Ethernet Media Access
Controller) driver provide APIs to transmit and receive packets with a
firmware based Ethernet switch that has been implemented on TI’s
PRU-ICSS (Programmable Real-Time Unit Subsystem and Industrial
Communication SubSystem) 32-bit RISC cores.

| 

.. rubric:: Software Architecture
   :name: software-architecture

The ICSS EMAC low level driver can be partitioned into the following:

-  Driver software running on the host processor, provides a well
   defined set of APIs to configure the driver, send packets to the
   firmware and receive packet from the firmware.
-  Firmware which implements a 2 port ethernet switch supporting 802.1d
   @100 Mbps. This runs on the TI-PRU-ICSS cores.

| 

.. rubric:: Driver Features
   :name: driver-features

ICSS_EMAC LLD implements following:

-  Rx - Copying packet received from firmware and providing it to TCP/IP
   stack
-  Tx - Providing packet from TCP/IP stack to firmware
-  Learning/Forwarding Data Base
-  Storm Prevention implementation
-  Host Statistics implementation
-  TCP/IP stack related initialization
-  Configuring IP address
-  ARM interrupt management

  `[1] <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_ICSS-EMAC-Design>`__

| 

.. rubric:: Driver Configuration
   :name: driver-configuration

| **Board Specific Configuration**
| All the board specific configurations eg: enabling clock and pin-mux
  for GPIO/MDIP/IEP pins should be performed before calling any driver
  APIs. By default Board_Init() API supports all initialization sequence
  for TI supported EVMs. In addition it initializes UART instance for
  Console/STDIO.Refer `Processor SDK RTOS Board
  Support </index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_Board_Support>`__ for
  additional details.Once board specific configuration is complete 
  driver APIS can be invoked.

| 
| **ICSS_EMAC Configuration Structure**
| The icss_emacSoc.c file contains the declaration of the hardware
  attributes corresponding to the ICSS_EMAC subsystem. Hardware
  attributes includes base address of various sub-subsystems required by
  the the ICSS_EMAC LLD. This configuration is required and needs to be
  passed in as part of the ICSS_EMAC Handle when calling the
  icss_emacInit API. For details about individual fields of this
  structure, see the Doxygen help by opening
  PDK_INSTALL_DIR\packages\ti\drv\icss_emac\docs\doxygen\html\index.html.

APIs for a use case of an EMAC example which implements single Ethernet
MAC using PRU-ICSS Instance 2, ETH0. For additional details refer
