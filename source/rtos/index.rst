   :name: introduction

The Texas Instruments Processor Software Development Kit (Processor-SDK)
is a single scalable software platform that offers streamlined development 
across different TI 'Sitara/DSP Processors <http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/processors/overview.page>'__. 
The Processor-SDK for RTOS provides fundamental platform software and tools 
for development, deployment and execution of RTOS-based applications. 
It includes the following, though not all features are applicable across 
all supported platforms:

-  TI-RTOS kernel, a light-weight real-time embedded operating system for TI devices
-  Chip support libraries, drivers, and basic board-support utilities
-  Interprocessor communication for communication across cores and devices
-  Basic networking stack and protocols
-  Optimized C66x algorithm libraries
-  Debug and instrumentation utilities
-  Bootloaders and boot utilities
-  Demonstrations and examples

Combined with TI Code Composer Studio integrated development environment (IDE), 
the Processor-SDK provides the core foundational building blocks that facilitate 
application software development on TI's embedded processors.

.. rubric:: Scope
   :name: scope

The purpose of this guide is to quickly provide the information you need most while 
evaluating and developing applications on a TI embedded processor, specifically 
running embedded real-time operating system. It is not intended to be a thorough 
design document. As such, the focus is on application programming interfaces (API), 
build information, and examples to use as a template to start development.
