Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Processor SDK RTOS for C6657, C6678, K2H, K2E, and K2L EVMs includes
a script in the directory

::

     [SDK Install Path]/processor_sdk_rtos_<platform>_<version>/bin

named **program_evm.js**. The purpose of this script is to automatically
flash bootable images onto your EVM.

The following sections will describe how to use this script and the
default flashable binaries in the Processor SDK RTOS.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  A Windows or Linux PC
-  Processor SDK RTOS installed on your PC. The version to install must
   match the SOC you plan to use
-  Code Composer Studio installed on your PC
-  An USB connection to your EVM emulator

.. note::
   Your board should be set to NO-BOOT mode. Please refer to the boot mode
   dip switch settings for different boot modes on your EVM Hardware User
   Guide. See :ref:`this page <RTOS-SDK-Supported-Platforms>` for
   a link to all supported EVM information.

Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The files used are in the Processor SDK RTOS directory. Expanded below
are the relevant files and directories for flashing the bootable images
for C667x, but a similar structure is used for C665x.

Default Binaries and Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Processor SDK RTOS provides the basic CCXML files to connect to your
SOC. There is a separate CCXML file for each SOC, emulator, and host OS
combination. These CCXML files are located in:

::

     [SDK Install Path]/processor_sdk_rtos_<platform>_<version>/bin/config/<SOC>

Users can choose to use their own CCXML file by setting the environment
variable, **PROGRAM_EVM_TARGET_CONFIG_FILE**, to point to their CCXML
file in their terminal or command prompt.

You can create your own CCXML file by opening CCSv6 --> View --> Target
Configurations, and right-clicking on the Target Configuration pane to
select New Target Configuration. After selecting your SOC and emulator,
remember to set the appropriate GEL file in the advance options for Core
0. The GEL file is used to do basic SOC initialization upon connecting
to the core.

Processor SDK RTOS also provides the basic binaries needed to perform
flashing. These are separated into two categories - flashwriters and
flash images.

Flashwriters

-  [C66x] eepromwriter_<SOC>.out - writes content to your EVM EEPROM
   flash memory
-  [C66x] norwriter_<SOC>.out - writes content to your EVM NOR flash
   memory
-  [C66x] nandwriter_<SOC>.out - writes content to your EVM NAND flash
   memory
-  [K2H/E/L] spi_flash_writer.out - writes multiple images to your NOR
   flash memory

Flash images

-  [C66x] eeprom50.bin - eeprom binary for address 0x50. The default for
   C66x is the POST application.
-  [C66x] eeprom51.bin - eeprom binary for address 0x51. The default for
   C66x is the Intermediate Boot Loader (IBL).
-  [C66x] nor.bin - nor binary to be used for NOR boot. May not be
   provided for every EVM or release version.
-  [C66x] nand.bin - nand binary to be used for NAND boot. May not be
   provided for every EVM or release version.
-  [K2H/K2E/K2L] app - NOR binary to be booted by Secondary Bootloader.
   The default for Keystone 2 is the POST application
-  [K2H/K2E/K2L] MLO - Secondary Bootloader. The default flash location
   is in SPI NOR flash memory at offset 0.

Usage
^^^^^

For Windows users:

::

     > cd [SDK Install Path]\processor_sdk_rtos_<platform>_<version>\bin
     > set DSS_SCRIPT_DIR=[CCS Install Path]\ccsv6\ccs_base\scripting\bin
     > %DSS_SCRIPT_DIR%\dss.bat program_evm.js [tmdx|tmds]evm(6678|6657|k2h|k2e|k2l)[l|le|ls][-le|-be]

For Linux users:

::

     > cd [SDK Install Path]/processor_sdk_rtos_<platform>_<version>/bin
     > export DSS_SCRIPT_DIR=[CCS Install Path]/ccsv6/ccs_base/scripting/bin
     > $DSS_SCRIPT_DIR/dss.sh program_evm.js [tmdx|tmds]evm(6678|6657|k2h|k2e|k2l)[l|le|ls][-le|-be]

The last argument depends on the SOC that you have, concatenated with
the options to select emulator and endianness:

-  l: EVM uses XDS100 on-board Emulator
-  le: EVM uses 560 Mezzanine Emulator daughter card
-  ls: EVM uses XDS200 Emulator card
-  -le: Little Endian
-  -be: Big Endian

.. note::
   -  By default, the images provided are little endian.
   -  Also by default, Keystone 2 EVMs are expected to only use the XDS2xx
      Emulator. You do not have to supply the emulator in the parameter for
      K2H/K2E/K2L.

Some examples are:

TMDXEVM6678LE little endian

::

      > $DSS_SCRIPT_DIR/dss.sh program_evm.js tmdxevm6678le-le

TMDSEVM6657LS little endian

::

      > $DSS_SCRIPT_DIR/dss.sh program_evm.js tmdxevm6657ls-le

EVMK2H little endian

::

      > $DSS_SCRIPT_DIR/dss.sh program_evm.js tmdsevmk2h

EVMK2E little endian

::

      > $DSS_SCRIPT_DIR/dss.sh program_evm.js tmdsevmk2e
