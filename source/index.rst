Thank you for choosing Processor SDK (Software Development Kit) which runs on
TI `embedded processors <http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/dsp/arm.page>`. Processor SDK is
a unified software framework providing easy setup and fast out-of-the-box access 
to benchmarks and demos. It allows developers to seamlessly reuse and migrate 
software across devices, and develop scalable platform solutions.
