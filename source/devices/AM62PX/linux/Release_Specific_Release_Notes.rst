Release Notes
************************************

Overview
========

The **Processor Software Development Kit (Processor SDK)** is a unified software platform for TI embedded processors
providing easy setup and fast out-of-the-box access to benchmarks and demos.  All releases of Processor SDK are
consistent across TI’s broad portfolio, allowing developers to seamlessly reuse and develop software across devices.
Developing a scalable platform solutions has never been easier than with the Processor SDK and TI’s embedded processor
solutions.

To simplify the end user experience, Processor SDK Linux AM62Px installer provides everything needed as discussed below
to create the embedded system from “scratch” :

-  Platform/board-support software and configuration files for Linux
-  U-Boot and Kernel sources and configuration files
-  An ARM cross-compiling toolchain as well as other host binaries and components
-  A Yocto/OE compliant filesystem and sources for example applications
-  A variety of scripts and Makefiles to automate certain tasks
-  Other components needed to build an embedded system that don’t fit neatly into one of the above buckets
-  Reference Examples, benchmarks

This release supports High Security - Field Securable (HS-FS) devices.
