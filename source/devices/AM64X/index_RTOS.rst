RTOS

.. note::
   In order to better support industry standards, TI is transitioning from TIRTOS to FreeRTOS in the next release of the SDK. Support for TIRTOS will be discontinued going forward.
   Any features used from TIRTOS will need to be migrated to FreeRTOS for support. It is recommended to focus near term efforts on utilizing the PDK, TIâ€™s low-level, RTOS independent software offering.
   It is highly recommended that customers refrain from implementing with TIRTOS or limit the usage so that migration to FreeRTOS will be easier.
