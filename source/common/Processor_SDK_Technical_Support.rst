Processor SDK Technical Support
========================================================
Technical support is a broad term. Our desire is to provide a solid
product, good documentation, and useful training that defines a clear
path for developing a product based on the Linux/RTOS/Android SDKs.
However, we know we'll never cover everything that can be done, and
occasionally we even make mistakes <gasp>. So, when you can't seem to
find what you need, there's a good place to search through previously
answered questions and ask a new one - The E2E Support Forums.

There is an active community of TIers and other customers like you
already using a TI Processor, on these forums. You may find your
question has already been answered with a quick Search of the Forums. If
not, a quick post will likely provide you the answers you need.
